The Confetti Magic App lets you press a shortcut to throw confetti! You can also let your mouse throw confetti. The app is inspired by the built-in confetti feature of the [Raycast app](https://www.raycast.com/).  
It is written in native Swift. Also, it's compatible with the [Clipboard Portal App](https://github.com/pal03377/ClipboardPortal): If both you and your friend have both apps installed, throwing confetti will also throw confetti on your friend's screen ðŸŽ‰
